These neighborhoods arguably should be at the top of the list for new investments in cycling infrastructure. The dark purple areas are those with high material deprivation but good cycling infrastructure, while the green areas are wealthier areas with good cycling infrastructure.\n",

The example data will be on urban health-related data in Canada (replicating the map above), but the methods and code can be applied to anywhere with two quantitative variables linked to the same set of geometries.\n",

I believe these were the first published bivariate maps, but if you are reading this and know of earlier bivariate maps, please let me know. I'd be super interested to see them."

    "A noted drawback with bivariate maps is that they are often not initially intuitive and sometimes require a good amount of looking back-and-forth with the legend, especially compared to univariate choropleth maps. Even with a 3x3 legend like the map above, it can take a bit of time to read the map and understand and parse out specific values (especially for the middle values). If you're more interested in understanding each variable on its own, rather than a direct comparison, it's probably best to stick with two side-by-side univariate choropleth maps. If you want to allow for comparison but keep things easier to read, a 2x2 legend might be better, but remember that different aggregation can lead to varying results!"
