It is our opinion that the proposed hose connection configuration will enhance the safety of fire department personnel responding to a fire scenario at the building, reduce smoke migration between floors during a fire department response condition, and remove a means by which non-trained personnel may endanger themselves by attempting to use a fire hose cabinet in an emergency. Note: this Alternative Solution Proposal specifically addresses the concepts associated with satisfying the intent of the OBC requirements for fire hose cabinets with the use of an alternative equipment configuration - the design of the standpipe system remains the responsibility of the project's fire protection system designer.
