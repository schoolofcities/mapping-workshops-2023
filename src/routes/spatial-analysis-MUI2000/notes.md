# Introduction

- Spatial Data
- Mapping / Visualization (e.g. decisions - abstraction)
- Geoprocessing

# Spatial Data

What is it?

Vector / Raster

Raster e.g satellite imagery

ACTIVITY - use my tool - zoom into a main street - come back with an interesting finding

Vector data
- Point, line, polygon
- show them on a table and on a map

Different representations of the same features

e.g. OpenStreetMap

e.g. Flow Data - Line data with values

Data sources - data use agreements

e.g. Toronto Open Data

ACTIVITY - take a look, what data on there would be useful for studying main streets, and why

e.g. Census data

Show map for example

e.g. Historical Business Data Axle - access via U of T


# Geoprocessing

Geocoding - getting a location from an address

Building permit data

Selecting by location

Spatial Joining

- points to polygon

- polygon to street


# Maps & Visualization

- Communication

Generalization 

Aggregation
